This repository contains the resources used during the <b>"Introducing Debugging - Unveiling the Power of Code Inspection"</b> workshop, hosted on May 23rd of 2024, during Research Club, at the [Center for Music in the Brain (MIB)](https://musicinthebrain.au.dk) - Aarhus University.

üéØ The main goal of the workshop was to show how to activate the debugging mode and set visual breakpoints in different IDEs (specifically Visual Studio Code, MATLAB environment, Spyder and JupyterLab). 

‚è±Ô∏è The workshop lasted about 90 minutes and it consisted of a theoretical part (slides presentation) followed by a hands-on section, where 5 cases of bugs where solved, using different IDEs and programming languages. 

The 5 cases of bugs are explained more in detail below. 


## Case 1Ô∏è‚É£
Python script used to code an experiment using PsychoPy - to be run in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

<b>Problem Description</b>
<p>This script is part of a [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/) experiment where a fixation cross is supposed to be displayed during certain phases of the trial. Due to an indentation error, the fixation cross does not appear as expected during the 'listen' phase.</p>


## Case 2Ô∏è‚É£
Debugging example to be run in [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Python. This case involves debugging a logical bug that occurs within multiple functions invoked in a Python script.

<b>Problem Description</b>
<p>In this scenario, we have a Python script with multiple functions spread across different files. The bug is not evident in the global variable scope but resides within one of the function scopes, making it challenging to identify. The script performs complex mathematical operations and file handling tasks.</p>

<b>Folder Structure</b>

The case follows a structured organization as follows:

 - <i>main_script_case_2_bug.py</i>: The main Python script where the bug manifests. It invokes functions from math_utils.py and general_utils.py.
 - <i>math_utils.py</i>: Contains mathematical utility functions such as square_elements, sum_of_squares, and multiply_elements.
 - <i>general_utils.py</i>: Includes general utility functions like export_to_csv and load_csv_to_dataframe.
 - <i>output/</i>: A directory to store the output CSV file generated by the script.


## Case 3Ô∏è‚É£
[MATLAB](https://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) script that categorizes participants into age groups based on their ages and then displays each participant's age along with their corresponding age group. To be run in MATLAB's environment. 

<b>Problem Description</b>
The script aims to iterate through a list of participants' ages and assign each participant to one of three age groups: 'young', 'adult', or 'old', according to predefined age group boundaries. However, the script is failing to categorize participants accurately, leading to incorrect age group assignments.


## Case 4Ô∏è‚É£
The script is designed to illustrate how logical errors can affect data visualization in R, usign [RStudio](https://posit.com/). Specifically, it aims to showcase how incorrect logical operators can lead to unexpected outcomes in data analysis and visualization tasks.

<b>Problem Description</b>
This case demonstrates a bug in generating a scatter plot. The bug arises from a logical error in attempting to highlight certain points on the plot.

## Case 5Ô∏è‚É£
This example demonstrates a common error encountered when filtering [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html) DataFrames using logical operators such as 'and' and 'or', implemented in [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

<b>Problem Description</b>
The error message "ValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous" occurs due to improper usage of logical operators. The error arises when attempting to filter a DataFrame based on multiple conditions using the 'and' operator. In this case, the conditions are applied to different columns of the DataFrame. The incorrect usage of 'and' with Pandas Series results in the ambiguity of the truth value, leading to the ValueError.
