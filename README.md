# Introducing Debugging 
## Unveiling the Power of Code Inspection
Resources used during the "Introducing Debugging - Unveiling the Power of Code Inspection" workshop, hosted on May 23rd of 2024, during Research club, at the Center for Music in the Brain (MIB) - Aarhus University.

## Case 1
[MATLAB](https://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) script that categorizes participants into age groups based on their ages and then displays each participant's age along with their corresponding age group. To be run in MATLAB's environment. 

<b>Problem Description<b>
The script aims to iterate through a list of participants' ages and assign each participant to one of three age groups: 'young', 'adult', or 'old', according to predefined age group boundaries. However, the script is failing to categorize participants accurately, leading to incorrect age group assignments.


## Case 2
Debugging example to be run in [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Python. This case involves debugging a logical bug that occurs within multiple functions invoked in a Python script.

<b>Problem Description<b>
In this scenario, we have a Python script with multiple functions spread across different files. The bug is not evident in the global variable scope but resides within one of the function scopes, making it challenging to identify. The script performs complex mathematical operations and file handling tasks.
Folder Structure

The repository follows a structured organization to facilitate debugging and comprehension:

 - main_script_case_2_bug.py: The main Python script where the bug manifests. It invokes functions from math_utils.py and general_utils.py.
 - math_utils.py: Contains mathematical utility functions such as square_elements, sum_of_squares, and multiply_elements.
 - general_utils.py: Includes general utility functions like export_to_csv and load_csv_to_dataframe.
 - output/: A directory to store the output CSV file generated by the script.
